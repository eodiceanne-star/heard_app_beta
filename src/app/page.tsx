            If you've ever been told "it's all in your head" or felt brushed aside by a rushed appointment, you're not alone. Heard was built for women and marginalized patients navigating chronic illness, misdiagnosis, delayed diagnosis, and the frustration of medical gaslighting.

          <p>
            Here, you can track your symptoms, connect with others who've been through the same struggles, and find scripts and resources to help you speak confidently at appointments. Heard is your safe space to feel validated, supported, and empowered â€” no matter where you are in your healthcare journey.
